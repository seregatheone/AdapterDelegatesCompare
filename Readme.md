# RecViewAdapterDelegate  

Compare two different adapter delegate libraries, make conclusion what to use in different situatuons.  

Well-known library -> `Adapters delegate`  https://github.com/sockeqwe/AdapterDelegates  
New tinkoff library -> `TiRecycler`https://github.com/tinkoff-mobile-tech/TiRecycler  

You can check TiRecyclerLibrary but i highly recommend not to use this library. It consists of unfinished logics and missed classes, which were documented in docs.  
If you use TiRecycler with coroutines, you write a lot of additional logics and rewrite author code.  

Taking everything into account, i won't use TiRecycler next time.
